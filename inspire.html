  <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
  <p>A hero is someone that is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievemnets, or noble qualities. A hero's most defining characteristics include bravery, moral integrity, courage, conviction, honesty, willingness to protect others and self-sacrificing.
  <p>Patricia Chacon who is more commonly known as Tricia Chacon was born on June 27th to Antoinette and Lorenzo Corralez. She grew up with siblings Lerenzo and Becky Corralez. At the age of 27 she married Victor Chacon, their marriage resulted in the birth of three children (Aubrey 22, Monica 20, and Nadene 14). She is honest, loyal, and kind among many other characteristics. She loves cooking, taking pictures, and taking care of children (both hers and others). Her favorite quote/saying is "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." -Luke 6:31 </p>
  <p>She is my hero because she always has room for more love in her heart and doesn't hestitate to share that love with the world. She strives for perfection as a mom, daughter, sister, and wife. In my opinion, she has achived that and more. Everyday I am inspired to become a better person so that I can be at least half of the hero she is. Her life hasn't been without struggles and setbacks but she uses all of this to push her towards helping others. Her honesty is something that many strive to achieve and her need to help others comes from her loving heart.
