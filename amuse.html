      <h2>Most Amusing Site</h2>
    <p>This website lets you play the warmer/colder game with a cow. You will need sound with this website because a voice says <i>"Cow."</i><br>This voice gets lounder or quieter according to the cursor's proximity to the cow. You are able to find other animals once you find the cow a certain amount of times.</p>
