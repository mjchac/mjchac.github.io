    <h1>Here are my top three most amusing sites. I have spent a lot of time on each of these sites so have fun!</h1>
      <h2>Most Amusing Site</h2>
    <p>Description: This website lets you play the warmer/colder game with a cow. You will need sound with this website because a voice says <i>"Cow."</i>This voice gets lounder or quieter according to the cursor's proximity to the cow. You are able to find other animals once you find the cow a certain amount of times.</p>

    <h2>Second Most Amusing Site</h2>
    <p>Description: This website takes you to a random website that is useless. Examples include a one square mineweeper game, corndog screen, a floating QR code (need to scan), etc.</p>

    <h2>Third Most Amusing Site</h2>
    <p>Description: I can't not have this website on this list. It's a website full of games that you can play to pass the time. Some examples include Papa's games, parking games, the Run games, etc.</p>
